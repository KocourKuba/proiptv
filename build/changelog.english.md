- Added TVIZI NET provider

### Version 3.2.438

- Minor changes to integrate the background indexing log into the main plugin log

### Version 3.2.410
- Added support for JSON versions of EPG downloaded from the provider's server or EPG provider (epg.drm-play.com) for well-known IPTV providers (the same as in IPTV Channel Editor). For older consoles, I recommend switching to the faster JSON version. Updating the EPG in this case is entirely up to the server.
- For new Dune HD boxes for the XMLTV engine, SQLite is always used, for old ones based on Sigma processors - Classic
- The settings for the selected EPG engine are no longer global, but specific for each provider.
- To quickly change the engine, a new item has been added to the popup menu on the categories screen
- When selecting the JSON engine (Web server), the display of some settings is disabled ("Channel icon source", "EPG cache time", "EPG fuzzy search") since such information is not available to it.
- When choosing a JSON engine (Web server), channel icons are taken only from the playlist!

If the provider has not specified the correct attributes for the channel ID, then when the link changes, the channel ID changes. Now the plugin can specify which attributes it can use as a channel ID.

### Version 3.1.358
- Added the ability to change the media library icon
- An error checking subscription information blocked access to the Media Library for Cbilling

The provider ID can be viewed when adding a provider through the menu; it is indicated in parentheses. For example Fox IPTV (fox), Glanz (glanz), IPTV Online (iptvonline)
- Editing the playlist is called by the Ok button
- Added xmltv sources for providers that do not provide them in the playlist

- Added additional intervals for XMLTV cache lifetime
- Minor optimization of unpacking XMLTV archives

- Items for updating the current playlist/XMLTV source have been removed from the settings as unnecessary
- Added QR codes for donation in the plugin
- Fixed a bug with editing previously hidden categories that are no longer present in the playlist
- Fixed a bug with restoring hidden categories if there was only one category

### Version 2.2
- Optimization of indexing XMLTV sources. Indexing time has been reduced by an average of 10-15 seconds for different types of sources
- For the SQLite engine, the program can be available much earlier than the indexing of the XMLTV source is completed due to the fact that it is a database. For the classic engine - only after indexing is completed
- Configured fuzzy EPG search. Disabled by default. In early versions the algorithm was enabled, in later versions it was disabled because it slowed down the search. Now it's up to the user. Principle: if the epg id specified in the playlist is not found in the XMLTV source, the plugin tries to find data by channel name. Made specifically for home-made playlists, where the epg id is written crookedly and does not correspond to the XMLTV EPG source data. If the EPG ID is not in the playlist, the plugin always searches by channel name. In cases where the channel name does not correspond to the XMLTV source (hello Sharavoz), I can’t do anything, write to Sportloto.
- Using the User-Agent setting to download playlists and XMLTV sources
- Force the use of the User-Agent setting (if it is not the default) for threads, unless one is specified for them.
- EPG ID from the playlist is shown in the information in the channel description (when channels are displayed accordingly or using the Info button)
- Setting to enable the generation of a list of pseudo program guides (TV program 1/2, etc.) if the EPG ID for the channel is not found, but the archive is present (different from 0). Disabled by default.

The new mode is not available on Sigma player, thanks to Dune HD for turning off sqlite support.
